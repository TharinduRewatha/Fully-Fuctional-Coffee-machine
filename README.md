# Fully-Fuctional-Coffee-machine
This is basically a coffee machine with a user mode and a operator mode


Actually this is a first semster assignment for my university(Dont copy paste and use it.Because I ve uploaded the assignment via turnitin and that will cause you to copyright issues and cheating issues as well D )

........................................................................................................................................
You are to write a program to manage an automatic coffee maker. Different types of coffee could be brewed from the machine and details about the coffee type, price and their country of origin should be stored in your program along with the availability levels of the raw materials. (Assume each type of coffee requires only one unique raw material such as a mixed power) 
Users can request for a coffee by inserting money into the machine. (you may get this as a CLI input from the user). Check relevant conditions and issue the requested coffee to the user and update the records accordingly. 
The operator may use your program to add new coffee type, modify item details such as the price, delete a type of coffee or to update the raw material stock (+/- quantity). The raw material level is measured as an integer representing the number of coffees that could be brewed and at one time the raw material for a particular type of coffee may not exceed 20. 
Additionally it should be possible to to view the value of all coffees brewed and the total number of coffees that could be brewed from the raw materials available at a given time.
